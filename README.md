# Wine Festival Schedule

This project showcases the basics of tables in HTML by creating a web page for the schedule of events at the Aguillar Family's wine festival. The table structure is used to display event timings and names, providing attendees with an easy-to-read schedule.

## Description

The Wine Festival Schedule project is an HTML-based web page that displays a table showcasing the schedule of events for the Aguillar Family's annual wine festival. It demonstrates the use of HTML table elements and headings to present the event details in a clear and organized manner.

## Project Tasks

- Create a `<table>` element inside the `<div>` element with the class "container" in the `index.html` file.
- Add a section for table headings using `<thead>`, and create two rows inside it using the table row element.
- Add an `<h1>` element inside the first table row with the text "Wine Festival Schedule".
- In the second table row, add two `<th>` elements: one with an `<h2>` for "Time" and another with an `<h2>` for "Event".
- Use `colspan="2"` in the opening `<th>` tag of "Wine Festival Schedule" to make it stretch across the entire table.
- Use `<tbody>` to section off the table body below the closing `</thead>` tag.
- Create five rows inside the table body using the table row element.
- Within each row, create two cells using the table data element, with the first one having the class "left".
- Add `<h3>` elements inside each `<td>` with the "left" class, representing the times of the events.
- Add `<h3>` elements inside the remaining `<td>` elements, representing the names of the events.
